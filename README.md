LIRI stands for "Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface".  LIRI is a node.js program run via the command line which utilizes various APIs and NPMs to return relevant information based on user input.

LIRI can take the following commands:

**concert-this** provides the date and location for the next upcoming show of a band or artist the user specifies. 

**spotify-this-song** provides the artist, album, and Spotify preview link for a song specified by the user.

**movie-this** provides the year of original release, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, country of production, language, plot, and actors for a movie title specified by the user.

**do-what-it-says** - reads one of the three commands listed above as well as the search criteria from "random.txt" and provides feedback through the command line in the same format as described above.
